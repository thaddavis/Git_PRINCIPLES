# Fundamentals

Git is a tool that will track every change that is made to every file and sub-directory of a particular folder.

Git is agnostic to the type of project you are tracking. Your folder (or your project) can contain code for an app/the pages of a book/the photos of album/etc. Git does not care.

At the end of the day, when viewed as raw data, every project (or folder), regardless of what it means to you, is just a collection of files and sub-folders.

Git will track every edit that is made to every file and every subfolder that is added or removed from a project.

Each time an edit occurs in your project, Git will track what was changed, who made the change, when the change was made, and why the change was made.

Git does this via a local database that stores all the snapshots of your project at different points in time.

The database is stored in the `.git` folder at the root of your project.

## (Check out DEMO 1 in the Demo_1.md folder)

## (Check out DEMO 2 in the Demo_2.md folder)

## (Check out DEMO 3 in the Demo_3.md folder)

And that's all folks!

I attempted to give you the fundamentals upon which the more advanced aspects of Git can be deduced : )

Ding!

Trippy presentation of the concept of first principles thinking:
